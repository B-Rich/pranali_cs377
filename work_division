CS377 OS Design Project
Team A3 - Virtual Memory

Work Division

We identify three major portions of the work to be done-

1) Swap space management (3)- 

	Create swap space for every program, on the Sim_disk. This will be an implement-from-scratch operation.
	Loading	program data in appropriate swap space- This will need us to make changes to function ld_load_exe, which currently loads all program data into goad-knows-where.
	Selection of initial pages to load in Pranali main memory

2) Page management and fault handling (2)- 
	
	Detect page faults.
	Call for page in and page out operations. This needs to assume presence of swap space.
	Page replacement policy falls under this ambit. Also, this needs to assume presence of page table lookup (part 3).

	Members- Sagar Jha (110100024), C Yeshwanth (110050083)

3) New page table implementation (1)- 
	Our group has been instructed to implement a multilevel page table.
	Changes to be made to existing structure of the page table and the page table entry.
